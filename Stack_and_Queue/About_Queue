Queue is a linear structure which follows the order is First In First Out (FIFO)
to access elements. Mainly the following are basic operations on queue:
Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear
The difference between stacks and queues is in removing.
In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
Both Queues and Stacks can be implemented using Arrays and Linked Lists.
