Stack is a linear data structure which the order LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)
for accessing elements. Basic operations of stack are : Push, Pop , Peek

We can use list as a stack in python.
Stack declaration : :
    A = [] # declares an empty stack. O(1)
Push
    A.append(newElement) # Put the new Element on the end of the array. O(1).
Pop
    A.pop()  # removes the last element. O(1)
isEmpty
    return (len(A) == 0); # Check if size is 0. O(1)
Size
    return len(A); # O(1)
Top
    A[-1] # O(1)

Llinked list implemtation of Stack
push ---> insert_at_last()-------O(n)
pop ----> remove_at_last() ----- O(n)

but main concern is insertion and delettion is performed by one end
if we made head ==  Top
then
push ---> insert_at_first()-------O(1)
pop ----> remove_at_first() ----- O(1)
